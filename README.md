# LPmerge
Editing the original LPmerge script from the tutorial
1) Tutorial script edited to have only 2 input maps
2) Edited to allow you to input the complete file name (including ".csv") as an argument
3) LPmerge function includes weights 
    - gives each map weight based on the number of markers in the group
4) Goes through all 20 linkage groups in one run rather than having to do each one individually
